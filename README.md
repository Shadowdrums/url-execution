# Remote Python Script Executor

This project consists of two scripts that work together to securely fetch and execute a remote Python script. It's useful for scenarios where you need to execute code hosted remotely.

## Overview

The solution allows you to host a Python script on a server (using a worker script) and fetch it securely from a client script (`url_execution.py`). The client script downloads the remote script, normalizes its indentation, and executes it locally.

## Files

### url_execution.py

This Python script performs the following actions:

1. **Fetches a Remote Script**: Uses `urllib.request` to make an HTTP request to a specified URL.
2. **Normalizes Indentation**: Adjusts the indentation of the downloaded script to ensure it executes correctly.
3. **Executes the Script**: Uses `exec()` to run the downloaded script in the global namespace.

#### Key Functions:

- `i_wasnt(url)`: Fetches content from the provided URL with custom headers and SSL context to handle certificates.
- `normalize_indentation(content)`: Removes leading spaces to normalize the indentation of the script.
- `even_there()`: Main function that fetches, cleans, and executes the remote script.

### worker.js

This JavaScript script is designed to be deployed as a serverless worker (e.g., on Cloudflare Workers). It serves the Base64-encoded Python script when requested.

#### How It Works:

- **Event Listener**: Listens for `fetch` events and responds with the `handleRequest` function.
- **Base64-Encoded Script**: Contains a Base64-encoded version of the Python script you want to serve.
- **Response**: Decodes the script and sends it as a downloadable file with appropriate headers.

## Setup and Usage

### Setting Up the Worker Script

1. **Encode Your Python Script**:

   - Encode the Python script you wish to serve in Base64:

     ```bash
     base64 your_script.py > encoded_script.txt
     ```

2. **Update `worker.js`**:

   - Replace the placeholder in `pythonScriptBase64` with the contents of `encoded_script.txt`:

     ```javascript
     const pythonScriptBase64 = `
     <your Base64-encoded script here>
     `;
     ```

3. **Deploy the Worker**:

   - Deploy `worker.js` to your serverless platform (e.g., Cloudflare Workers).

### Running the Python Script

1. **Update `url_execution.py`**:

   - Replace `"your url here"` with the URL where your worker script is accessible:

     ```python
     url = "https://your-worker-url.workers.dev"
     ```

2. **Run `url_execution.py`**:

   ```bash
   python url_execution.py
   ```
The script will fetch the remote Python code, normalize its indentation, and execute it.
Security Considerations

### Execution Risks: 
- Using exec() to run remote code is inherently risky. Ensure that the remote script is from a trusted source.
### SSL Verification: 
The script uses an unverified SSL context (ssl._create_unverified_context()). For better security, modify the script to verify SSL certificates.
- Content Sanitization: The script normalizes indentation but does not sanitize the content. Be cautious about code injection.
## Use Cases
### Dynamic Code Updates: 
Fetch updated code without redistributing the client script.
### Centralized Control: 
Centralize control over scripts executed by multiple clients.
### Educational Purposes: 
Demonstrate remote code execution and handling in Python.
